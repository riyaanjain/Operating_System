# 🖥️ Operating System Kernel

This repository contains the source code for a basic Linux-like kernel developed as part of a group project by four students.

## 🧠 Overview
We built a simplified operating system kernel inspired by Linux architecture. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with core OS concepts such as:

- Process management
- Memory management
- File systems
- System calls
- Scheduling

## ⚙️ Key Features
- Basic multitasking and process control
- Simple file system support
- System call interface
- Round-robin scheduling

## 👨‍💻 Team
Developed in a team of four for academic purposes. This project served as a learning platform for understanding how operating systems work under the hood.

## 📁 Structure
- `src/`: Core kernel source files  
- `include/`: Header files  
- `docs/`: Documentation and design notes  

## 🚀 Getting Started
To build and run the kernel, follow the instructions provided in the source directory. Requires a Unix-like environment and common build tools (e.g., GCC, Make).

## 📚 Note
This was an educational project and is not meant for production use.
