Bugs for CP1

Bug #1 - Aryan, paging

Date: 03/18/2024
Problem: Not handling bits properly
Fix: Read through documentation for the offsets in paging.h for memory bits, changed to 22 (4MB) and 12(4KB). Also checking to make sure that different addresses are being set properly.

Bug #2 - Aryan, paging

Date: 03/18/2024
Problem: Control Registers not updating properly
Fix: Include '$' before hex value

Bug #3 - Aryan and Kushal, paging

Date: 03/19/2024
Problem: Boot Loop
Fix: Initially a TA told us that it was our ASM code, however our C code for setting the struct values in paging.c were not correct. We had to read through documentation and fix it accordingly.

Bug #4 - Aryan, paging

Date: 03/18/2024
Problem: Syntax error when initializing page directory in paging.h
Fix: Ended up not being a syntax error at that line itself, but when defining the typset the declaration after brackets was wrong

Bug #5 - Aryan and Kushal, paging

Date: 03/19/2024
Problem: Struct issues in paging.h
Fix: Had to abandon a method in which we defined 2 structs for 4KB and 4MB separately, made them into a union, and then only defined 1 PDE to be used when defining struct values in paging.C
Instead, we combined the structs into 1 typedef and then combined the values since they are all 32-bits anyways. We created 1 PDE variable and 2 PTEs for manipulation in paging.c

Bug #6 - Aryan and Kushal, paging

Date: 03/19/2024
Problem: Boot Loop
Fix: Accessing the first 4KB page at the 0th index within an entire loop from 0 to the 1024 4-byte entries will cause paging to boot loop.

Bugs for CP2

Bug #7 - Aryan, Pranav, Riyaan, filesystem
Problem: Displaying files for read_dentry_by_index
Fix: We had to look inside the fsdir files to see how many files we wanted and kept changing our loop maximum value until we saw all the files we needed.

Bug #8 - Aryan, Pranav, filesystem
Problem: Calculating index for read_directory
Fix: We defined a global variable for file_count, and incremented it each time a filename was copied to our buffer. This variable was passed into our read_dentry_by_index call in read_directory

Bug # 9 - Aryan, Pranav, filesystem
Problem: Utilizing proper stdlib functions
Fix: Being aware of the different file types used and when to use functions such as strcmp, strncpy, memcpy instead of arithmetic comparisons in C
